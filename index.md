  Welcome to the personal blog of Shin Ji-Yong, an on/off-line book club manager. I have been organizing and participating in a book club since 2013. This blog is for documenting the club's ongoing activities.

  The club members meet biweekly on Saturday morning and exchange thoughts on a selected reading. The reading list includes literature, philosophy, history, science, engineering, politics, economics, and social issues. Sometimes, we just read a magazine or watch a film.
